🌟 Features
 Interactive Gameplay: Use arrow keys to control a robotic arm and sort waste.
 Educational: Teaches about waste categories like plastic, metal, and paper.
 Score System: Earn points for correct sorting and lose points for incorrect moves.
 Dynamic Objects: Randomized waste items and speeds for replayability.
 
🎮 How to Play
1.Run the game:
    python main.py

2.Use the arrow keys to control the robotic arm:
    Left/Right: Move the arm horizontally.
    Up/Down: Move the arm vertically.
	
3. Pick up waste items and drop them into the correct bins:
    Plastic: Blue Bin
    Metal: Green Bin
    Paper: Red Bin

4.Earn points for correct sorting. Avoid letting waste fall off the screen!
